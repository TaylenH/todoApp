## What I learned 
---
This App is the first time I worked with TypeScript in an actual Project and I got far more used to the way it handles, and how to find the correct types for third-party libraries. It is also the first time I used the IndexedDB Api, Which took me a while to figure out exactly how to use, but it was a very good learning experience. Finally, I used Material-ui more in depth than I ever have in this project, I learned a lot about the components in the library, and came to a new appreciation of well structured documentation.
